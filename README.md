RNA-Seq meta analysis workflow for the small peptide review article

----------------

All differential gene expression analysis was performed using code available in the RNASeq_analysis folder

Counts tables can be found by searching the GSE ids for each dataset on the Gene Expression Omnibus database.
Counts tables were downloaded as .gz files and read into RStudio manually.

Supplementary data for the review article is provided as an excel file: HS_DEG_meta_analysis_results.xlsx
